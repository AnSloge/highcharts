# Light dark theme detection
This demo contains a CSS module called `lightDarkTheme`. This allows user to style the dashboard based on the theme selected on the user's machine.<br>
If your dashboard contains Highcharts charts, you have to enable the styled mode.

To test it, please change the default theme in your computer options.
