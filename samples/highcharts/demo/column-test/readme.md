# Column test

A [column chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column), like the bar chart, is often used to
visualize **comparisons** of data sets with discrete data, where the focus is on the values instead of categories as
people read from left to right. This demo visualizes estimated corn vs wheat production for 2020.

The code of this demo is very simple to set, like the bar chart, as many features are already set by default such as the
responsiveness, tooltip, colors, legends, etc.
