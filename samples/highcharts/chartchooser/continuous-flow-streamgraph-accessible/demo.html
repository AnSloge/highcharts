        Chart showing the relative Google search trend popularity over time for the common JavaScript frameworks Angular, React, Vue, and Node. Overall, the searches for these frameworks in total peaked in early 2016, having more than halved since then. The most popular framework used to be Angular, but it has declined strongly, and was the least searched for framework out of the four in early 2022. Apart from Angular, the search volume for the other frameworks has remained relatively stable since 2017. By far the most popular framework in later years is Node.
